Priyongkar Kundu's Pet Owner Profile
What kind of pet owner am I?
I have never had a dog in my life, not do I know how to care for one. I lives
in a house with a backyard so  canine companion will have a good amount of
space. I am currently enrolled as a student at the University of Sydney and I currently also work which means I wont be able to give my dog much attention. However my family loves dogs so
he/she will have a loving and caring family too.
Priyongkar's Message to her paw-fect companion

park, meet other doggos together. I’ll give you lots of tweats and let you sleep
in hooman bed wight next to me every night. I’ll buy you lots of sqeeky toys and
give you many belly wubs.”
